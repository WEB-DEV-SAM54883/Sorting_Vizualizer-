# Sorting Vizualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web tool that helps users understand sorting algorithms visually. Input or generate random arrays, choose an algorithm (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort), and watch the sorting process. Features adjustable speed and sound effects for swaps. Ideal for students, educators, and anyone learning sorting algorithms.

# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application that visualizes different sorting algorithms. Users can input their own array of numbers or generate a random array, and then see how various sorting algorithms sort the array step-by-step.

## Features

- Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- User input for custom arrays.
- Random array generation.
- Adjustable sorting speed.
- Start and stop sorting at any time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sorting-visualizer
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

### Running Locally

After following the installation steps, open `index.html` in your web browser. The sorting visualizer should load and be ready to use.

### Controls

- **Submit**: Enter your own array of numbers separated by spaces.
- **Randomize Array**: Generate a random array of numbers.
- **Start Sorting**: Begin the sorting visualization using the selected algorithm.
- **Stop Sorting**: Stop the sorting visualization at any time.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the movement of elements.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the unsorted list into sublists until each sublist contains one element, then merges the sublists to produce new sorted sublists.
- **Quick Sort**: Selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
